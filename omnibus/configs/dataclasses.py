"""
DECREE:
 - *can* inject raw dataclasses - just eager init lol
  - still custom connfig subclass for later - dynamic shit

TODO:
 - do not use HAS_FACTORY - use native MISSING marker
 - deep interop w defaults
 - kinda has to take over init..
  - move InitBuilder to Processor?
 - post-init? .. why not.
 - ** rebuild / subclass config ala compcache w/ config storage** - ctors will check.isinstance

Q:
 - existing conventional ctor vs unary 'source' ctor
  - q of lazy vs eager
  - **DECREE** going with unary 'source' ctor PREEMPTIVELY despite initially being overkill
